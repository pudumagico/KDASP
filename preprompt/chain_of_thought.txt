You are also required to produce a chain of thought using the predicates in the theory,
showing how you arrived to the correct answer using them.
Output a line for each predicate used.
Separate the response rules from the chain of thought by a line of three asterisks.
The first predicate must be scene and the last predicate must be ans.
Only output one line per predicate used. 
Do not output state predicates.
No rules should be below the three asterisks.
