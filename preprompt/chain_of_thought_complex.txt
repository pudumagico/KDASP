You are also required to produce a chain of though using the predicates in the theory,
showing how you arrived to the correct answer using them.
Follow the steps below to break down domain knowledge and construct the rules:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   Briefly describe the problem domain and the specific goal.

2. **Break Down the Domain Knowledge:**
   Identify key concepts and entities in the problem domain.
   List relevant properties and relationships between these entities.

3. **Formulate If-Then Statements:**
   For each identified relationship or property, write an if-then statement that captures the logic of the relationship.
   Ensure that each statement is clear and logically sound.

4. **Construct Logic Rules:**
   Convert the if-then statements into Clingo syntax.
   Ensure that the rules are syntactically correct and cover the intended logic comprehensively.

YOU MUST FIRST OUTPUT THE NEW RULES.
THEN YOU MUST OUTPUT A LINE WITH THREE ASTERISKS.
THEN YOU MAY OUTPUT THE CHAIN OF THOUGHT AN ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
