4. Question Representation

Consider the following ASP representation for natural language questions.
The representation shows the steps needed to solve the question.

The representation is related to a problem involving graph traversal or analysis, 
where nodes represent stations and edges represent connections (or lines) between those stations. 
The variables and predicates in the questions can be interpreted as follows:

end(stepNumber):

    Description: Indicates the end of the computation or query process. The stepNumber defines the step number at which this stage occurs.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

countNodesBetween(stepNumber):

    Description: Counts the number of nodes between two specified stations minus 1.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

shortestPath(stepNumber):

    Description: Finds the shortest path between two stations or nodes.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

station(stepNumber, stationName):

    Description: Refers to a specific station in the context of the query. The stationName can be replaced with the name or identifier of a station.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step), stationName (a string or variable representing the station's name).

shortestPathAvoid(stepNumber, avoidList):

    Description: Finds the shortest path while avoiding certain nodes or stations.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step), avoidList (a list of station or node identifiers to avoid).

withinHops(stepNumber, hops):

    Description: Identifies stations or nodes within a certain number of hops.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step), hops (an integer representing the maximum number of hops).

closestArch(stepNumber, archName):

    Description: Finds the closest arch (a connection or link between nodes) based on the given name or identifier.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step), archName (a string or variable representing the arch's name).

paths(stepNumber):

    Description: Identifies paths between stations or nodes.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

cycle(stepNumber):

    Description: Identifies a cycle (a path that starts and ends at the same station or node).
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

adjacent(stepNumber):

    Description: Identifies nodes or stations that are adjacent to each other.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

adjacentTo(stepNumber):

    Description: Finds stations or nodes adjacent to a specific station or node.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

adjacentArch(stepNumber, archName):

    Description: Finds arches adjacent to a specified station or node.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step), archName (a string or variable representing the arch's name).

commonStation(stepNumber):

    Description: Finds common stations between paths or connections.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

exist(stepNumber):

    Description: Checks for the existence of a specific station or node in the network.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

linesOnNames(stepNumber):

    Description: Identifies lines based on their names.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

linesOnCount(stepNumber):

    Description: Counts the number of lines passing through a station or node.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

sameLine(stepNumber):

    Description: Checks whether two or more stations or nodes are on the same line.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

stations(stepNumber):

    Description: Refers to multiple stations, possibly in relation to a line or path.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step).

line(stepNumber, lineName):

    Description: Refers to a specific line in the context of the query. The lineName can be replaced with the name or identifier of a line.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step), lineName (a string or variable representing the line's name).

mostArch(stepNumber, archName):

    Description: Finds the arch with the most connections or weight in the network.
    Variables: stepNumber (an integer indicating the computation step), archName (a string or variable representing the arch's name).
