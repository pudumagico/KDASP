3. Scene Representation

Consider the following ASP representation for a metro graph.

It consists of possibly multiple predicates of the form 'node(N,C)', where N is the name of the station and C is the color,
'edge(N1,N2,C)', where N1,N2 are names and C is the color of the edge and 'line(C)', where C is the color of the metro line.

An excerpt of an example of such an encoding is the following:

node(vuirst,olive).
node(schnoms,olive).
node(mccreofy,olive).
node(crirg,olive).
edge(crirg,schnoms,cyan).
edge(reiards,niath,pink).
edge(niath,skoack,pink).
line(olive).
line(cyan).
line(pink).
